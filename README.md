# GTFS app setup

Most of MobilityDataDev's projects share the same basic setup, namely:

- a frontend web application
- a NodeJS backend server
- a PostgreSQL database (containing GTFS data)
- and Docker containers to run it all.

This repository contains the starter code/configuration for all of the above, to enable fast setup for new projects.

Fork it or create your own copy by following the tutorial at https://mobilitydatadev.com/article/set-up-a-gtfs-app to get started on your own GTFS-based mobility app.
